      <p>My Name is Balogun Ajibola Ridwan. I was born in 2002 right in heart of Lagos but grew up outskirt of Lagos. I am hailed from Oyo State. I am a Muslim. I am the second born of my family. My best food for now is beans. I don't even know my best colour till now.</p>
      
      <p>In 2019, I graduated from Secondary school. After that i spent almost one year as an apprentice training on how to repair laptops at Computer village, Ikeja.</p>
      
      <p>I left Lagos for Ilorin to study and sit for A'levels program. I sat for it and came out in fling colours all grace belongs to the Almighty. I have been giving admission into the presigious university UNILORIN. I will be resuming this next session by the grace if God.</p>

      <h1 id="about"  role="heading">Why i joined Altschoolafrica</h1>
      
      <p>let's go back to 2021 when i started my apprenticeship. I find it difficult to adjust to the new environment. Yes, the street was cold and not cool with this young boy. I had a lot of bad experiences with my boss which pushed me to start looking for things that i will love doing and what will make me look worth in my Eyes of my Boss.</p>
      
      <p>I came across an advertisement video of Professor Charles Severance. He was advertising is Python course. It was a good thing, good enough for me it was free so i hoped in. I thought after the whole python course i will have become a software engineer and i could start applying for remote roles. Yes, that was what i thought at that time(stupid me). Spent my time after work, weekends and free time carefully, deligently and judiciously on it. I did it for months. I think i had only one module left in the course to complete the course before my parents told me about A'levels program. So i had to leave for Ilorin to prepare for the Exams. The program was loaded and my time schedule was so hectic that i could not even think of writing code. That decision still pains me till today.</p>
      
      <p>After i sat for my exams, i knew i had work to do. I didn't want to go to back to software engineering. I was thinking of going into cyber security. I started with Cisco skill for all. It wasn't easy and the laptop i didn't have affected me alot. After months without seeing results that satisfys me and i was frustrated so i left.</p>
      
      <p>Later last year, I started with learning html and css but when i started with learning JavaScript, i started having dedication and focus issues. It became really difficult as i went deeper. I really struggled. I heard of Altschoolafrica and i think is gonna be a good a good idea since it is going to be like a normal school where you can have peers who will keep on motivating you. Atleast you know you will graduate at the end of the term if hard work is put into it instead of just going out there studying blindly and getting frustrated almost every single time. I also think it will help with my dedicate and focus issue since i will be studying with like minds.</p>
